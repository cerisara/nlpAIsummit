## ANITI

[https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/)

ANITI has 3 main missions: scientific research, training and economic development related to AI. ANITI aims to develop a new generation of artificial intelligence called hybrid AI, integrating data driven learning techniques and symbolic or mathematical models that permit us to express constraints and to carry out logical reasoning. ANITI also has ambitious aims with regard to education and industrial development. The ambition of ANITI is to develop a new generation of artificial intelligence called hybrid AI, associating in an integrated way data driven machine learning techniques and symbolic and formal methods allowing to express constraints and to carry out logical reasoning.

ANITI will be represented by Nicholas Asher at the event.

ENACT is a consortium of Eastern France bringing together actors from the academic world, public institutions including the Grand Est Region, and private companies. It focuses on strategic areas such as automatic language processing, AI for engineering and scientific discovery, and digital health. With this national and regional support, ENACT aims to position Eastern France as a European leader in artificial intelligence. The project aims to attract the best talent in artificial intelligence and to develop this technology more widely in France. To this end, ENACT will fund 18 Research and Innovation Chairs as well as an International Chairs Programme.

ENACT will be represented by Christophe Cerisara at the event.
